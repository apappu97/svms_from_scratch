Code for creating and training an SVM from scratch (i.e. just using numpy). Includes implementations for Log barrier Interior Point method with feasible start Newton and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).
An example Jupyter Notebook training an SVM with both optimization methods on the MNIST dataset is included. 

Note, code is for a binary SVM classifier.
